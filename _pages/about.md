Hi! I'm Tim, and yes, I like Star Trek.

This website was created as a way for me to document the various projects i've decided to embark on.

> Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before!
