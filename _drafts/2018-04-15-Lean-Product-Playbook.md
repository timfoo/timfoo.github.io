The Lean Product Process is a methodology for iterating your way towards better product-market fit. In a nutshell, you begin in the "problem space" by defining what your target customers are seeking. Then, you move to the "solution space" of creating a fitting product to meet the needs of your target customers.

Olsen uses the illustration of a pyramid to provide an actionable model that defines what product-market fit really means. You begin by climbing the pyramid from the bottom up to go through the 5 different aspects of your product and your market in order to achieve superior product-market fit.

### The Lean Product process
#### 1) Determine your Target Customers
#### 2) Identify Underserved Customer Needs
#### 3) Define your Value Proposition
#### 4) Specify your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feature Set
#### 5) Create your MVP Prototype
#### 6) Test your MVP with Customers

### Building and Optimizing your product
Once you've built your MVP and tested it, it's time to build upon it and start to add features that will increase the value delivered to your users. Iterating out of the MVP stage will probably benefit from the implementation of Agile development methodologies (e.g. SCRUM, Kanban, etc...) These methodologies allow you to shape your product using incremental and iterative steps to reduce your overall risk of failure.

Improving upon each iteration requires information. While iterating, be sure to implement quality assurance measures to assess the success and customer response to each iteration. Product analytics will help you to have a better understanding of your customers and their behaviors.
